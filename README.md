# ResUNet-DeepONet-Plasticity
Implementation of a ResUNet-based DeepONet for predicting stress distribution on variable input geometries subject to variable loads. A ResUNet is used in the trunk  network to encode the variable input geometries, and a feed-forward neural network is used in the branch to encode the loading parameters.
